# ✅ Database is Ready! Now Restart the Server

## The database has been created successfully!

The SQLite database `dev.db` is now in your backend folder.

## Next Step: Restart the Backend Server

1. **Stop the current server:**
   - Go to the terminal/command prompt where the server is running
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it

2. **Start it again:**
   ```cmd
   cd "d:\OneDrive\Desktop\REAL ESTATE\backend"
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **You should see:**
   ```
   Server running on port 5000
   ```

4. **Try registration again!**

The database is now set up and ready to use. Once you restart the server, registration should work!

## What Changed?

- Switched from PostgreSQL to SQLite (no separate database server needed)
- Database file: `backend/dev.db` (created automatically)
- All tables are created and ready

## If You Still Get Errors

Make sure:
- ✅ Server is restarted (stopped and started again)
- ✅ No other errors in the terminal
- ✅ Browser console shows no new errors

Try registering again - it should work now! 🎉
